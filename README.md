## Overview

OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner. It depends on open data in open standard file formats (GTFS and OpenStreetMap), and includes a REST API for journey planning as well as a map-based Javascript client. OpenTripPlanner can also create travel time contour visualizations and compute accessibility indicators for planning and research applications. For more information, see the project website: http://opentripplanner.org

## GSC-Opentripplanner 

GSC-Opentripplanner is a OTP's customization that adds the calculation on the production of CO2 to the paths obtained and the new modal "drive to park".
